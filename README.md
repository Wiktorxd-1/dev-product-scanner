# What Is dev-product-scanner

This is a scanner that scans new developer products for new universes. This can also scan description changes, name changes, price changes, and image changes.

## Setup

1. Download source code from here: https://github.com/editlt/dev-product-scanner/releases/tag/v1.0.0

2. Extract folders, and rename .env.example to .env

3. Create a discord bot here: https://discord.com/developers/applications. Feel free to customize it however you like, but after creating, get the bots token, and put this into .env under bot_token

4. Next, invite the bot. Click the OUATH2 button on the side of the screen. Scroll to url generator, select bot. Below, give it any permissions you like, and then copy the link at the bottom to invite it to a server.

5. Once in the server, get a channel ID. You will need to activate developer mode for this. Put the channel id in .env under channelId=

6. For setting up mongodb, I recommend watching this tutorial: https://youtu.be/oVHQXwkdS6w. Once you get the connection string, put it under mongo_db_token=

7. Finally, choose the game you want to scan updates on developer products for. Get the place id which is in the link (https://roblox.com/games/PLACEID), and take that id and put it here: https://apis.roblox.com/universes/v1/places/PLACEIDHERE/universe. This will return your universe id, which goes into universeId=

8. Run the bot using node index in the terminal.
